# Project OVAL

**Project On-campus Vehicle Autonomous Launch (OVAL)** is a research and development project aimed at designing an autonomous vehicle capable of navigating NC State University's campus. The project provides a platform for students to test autonomous vehicle algorithms in a real-world environment. Additionally, it opens possibilities for campus applications such as package delivery, security patrols, plant monitoring, or other autonomous tasks.

The system architecture includes:

* **Onboard Computer (Jetson Orin)** â€“ Runs ROS2 nodes for perception, control, and navigation.
* **GUI Computer** â€“ Provides a graphical interface for monitoring and control.
* **AWS EC2 Web Server** â€“ Optional remote server for logging, telemetry, or additional processing.

ðŸ’¡ *Suggested addition:* A system diagram showing the connections between Jetson, sensors, GUI, and AWS could help new users visualize the setup.

## Startup Sequence for Onboard Computer (Jetson Orin)

The Jetson Orin runs several ROS2 nodes to interface with the vehicle hardware. The primary nodes are:

* `joy_node` â€“ Reads XBox controller inputs
* `swiftnav_ros2_driver` â€“ Interfaces with the Piksi Multi GNSS
* `zed_camera` â€“ Streams stereo camera data
* `xbox_controller_node` â€“ Handles additional controller features
* `motor_actuation_node` â€“ Sends commands to the motors

ðŸ’¡ *Suggested addition:* Include a table summarizing each node, its purpose, and required hardware.

### **Joy Node**

Outputs joystick inputs from the XBox controller.

```bash
ros2 run joy joy_node --ros-args -p autorepeat_rate:=0.0
```

---

### **ZED Camera Node**

Outputs ZED camera topics. Documentation: [Stereolabs ZED ROS2 Node](https://www.stereolabs.com/docs/ros/zed-node).

```bash
ros2 launch zed_wrapper zed_camera.launch.py camera_model:=zed2i
```

#### ZED2i Setup

1. **Check CUDA installation**

```bash
nvidia-smi
```

2. **Install ZED SDK**
   Follow the [official ZED SDK installation instructions](https://www.stereolabs.com/developers/release/latest/) for NVIDIA Jetson. This may take \~30 minutes.

3. **Set up the environment**
   Follow the [ROS2 environment setup instructions](https://www.stereolabs.com/docs/ros2).

ðŸ’¡ *Suggested addition:* Include instructions for testing the ZED camera stream after setup.

---

### **RTK Piksi Multi Setup**

Setup instructions for the SwiftNav Piksi Multi ROS2 package.

#### Step 1 â€“ Installation

Follow the [SwiftNav ROS2 package instructions](https://github.com/swift-nav/swiftnav-ros2).

#### Step 2 â€“ TCP Connection Setup

If TCP connection issues occur, set up the Jetson Ethernet interface manually:

```bash
sudo ip addr add 192.168.0.100/24 dev eno1
ping 192.168.0.222
```

#### Step 3 â€“ Optional USB Setup

USB may be preferable to avoid Ethernet setup. Some RS232-to-USB adapters may not work on the Jetson due to missing drivers.

Check for the PL2303 driver:

```bash
zcat /proc/config.gz | grep -i 'pl2303'
```

If it returns `#CONFIG_USB_SERIAL_PL2303 is not set`, use an FTDI or CH340/CH341 adapter.

#### Step 4 â€“ Run the Node

```bash
ros2 launch swiftnav_ros2_driver start.py
```

ðŸ’¡ *Suggested addition:* Add a small troubleshooting section for common GNSS issues (e.g., no fix, bad TCP connection).

---

### **PyVESC Library Setup**

#### Step 1 â€“ Navigate to Project Directory

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws/src/project-oval
```

#### Step 2 â€“ Clone PyVESC

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LiamBindle/PyVESC.git
cd PyVESC
```

#### Step 3 â€“ Install Dependencies

```bash
python -m pip install -e .
python -m pip install pyserial
```

#### Step 4 â€“ Test Driver Node

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws/src/project-oval/project-oval
python driver_node.py
```

ðŸ’¡ *Suggested addition:* Include instructions for ROS2 integration with PyVESC and how to verify motor actuation.

### **Additional Recommendations for README**

1. **System Requirements:** List Jetson OS version, ROS2 version, Python version, and minimum hardware requirements.
2. **Startup Script:** Consider creating a single script to launch all nodes in the correct order.
3. **Troubleshooting Section:** Include common error messages for ROS2, ZED, Piksi Multi, and PyVESC.
4. **Data Logging:** Provide instructions for recording sensor or GNSS data for research purposes.
5. **References:** Include links to relevant ROS2, ZED, Piksi, and PyVESC documentation for quick reference.
